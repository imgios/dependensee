  <br/>Relaxed functional dependencies visualization web app.
</p>

## What is Dependensee?
Dependensee is the subject of my Computer Science thesis and the idea is to build a web app that visualize a plain text file (.txt) of RFDs (ndr. *relaxed functional dependencies*). This will be done with Ionic, Angular and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for manipulating data documents.

### Development
Development-related progress can be seen in the `develop` branch.

## Prerequisites
- latest Node.js and npm
- Ionic v4

## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/imgios/dependensee.git
cd dependensee
ionic serve
```
