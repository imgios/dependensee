  <br/><sup>Relaxed functional dependencies visualization web app</sup>
</p>

## What is Dependensee?
Dependensee is the subject of my Computer Science thesis and the idea is to build a web app that visualize a minimal set of RFDs (ndr. *relaxed functional dependencies*) extracted from a dataset (plain text file) with a given threshold. This will be done with Ionic, Angular and [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for manipulating data documents.

## Development
Development-related progress can be seen in the `develop` branch.

### Prerequisites
- latest Node.js and npm
- Ionic v4

### Run
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/imgios/dependensee.git
$ cd dependensee && npm install
$ ionic serve
```
